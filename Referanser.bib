	abstract = {To manage environmental problems in an adequate way, it is essential to take different spatial scales into consideration. As a tool for decision making, it would be beneficial if valuation methods take spatial scales into account as well. In this article, we review the valuation literature with regard to the spatial scales of environmental public goods and services to which the contingent valuation method, hedonic pricing method, and travel cost method have been applied in the past. We classified 117 environmental case studies to the local, landscape/watershed, regional, and global scales. These case studies cover a broad range of environmental goods and services, such as green space in a city, air quality, rivers, natural areas, and a stable climate system. Additionally, we took into account the year of publication of the case studies. Our results show that the majority of the environmental case studies are related to the local and landscape/watershed scales. However, the number of case studies on the regional and global scales has been increasing in recent years. This article argues that such a change in spatial scale calls for a debate on scaling issues in the field of environmental valuation.},

The results suggest that the {EKC} exists for carbon dioxide emissions for cross-country data over the period 1984–2002. However, there is nothing automatic about this relationship; policies designed to protect the environment may be responsible for this phenomenon. Two other significant findings are: one, countries with better quality of governance, stronger political institutions, better socioeconomic conditions and greater investment in education have lower emissions; and two, only around 15\% of the countries in the dataset have reached income levels high enough to be associated with an unambiguous decline in emissions. The implications of these results are discussed within the context of the international environmental policy arena and the Kyoto Protocol. One of the main objectives of this paper is to bridge the gap between studies conducted on the {EKC} and developments in the international environmental policy arena. As a final note this paper emphasizes that one needs to connect the body of knowledge on the {EKC} hypothesis to the international environmental policy arena, despite the apparent difficulty of doing so. One hopes that future studies will further build on this line of thought.},

	abstract = {The environmental attitudes of young people are a growing topic of interest for social scientists. Most research that aims to explain differences in (youth) environmental attitudes focuses on the individual as the level of measurement. There is, however, a growing body of evidence that illustrates that the context within which that individual operates can contribute to their environmental attitudes. Based on the {PISA} 2006 data, and while controlling for individual characteristics, we tested Inglehart’s ‘objective problems, subjective values’ hypothesis. This hypothesis divides the contextual influences on environmental attitudes into (1) objective problems in the individual’s natural environment and (2) subjective values linked to post-materialistic goals in life. We analyzed both the individual and the country level simultaneously, controlling for compositional effects, by performing a multilevel analysis on the 2006 {PISA} data for youth environmental attitudes (398,750 15 year olds from 56 countries). At the individual level, the results are generally consistent with the literature; at the contextual level, the stage of development of a country (as a proxy for post-materialistic values) is shown to be unrelated to environmental attitudes. Both natural riches of a country and its environmental problems are shown to positively influence the environmental attitudes of that country’s youth. These results are discussed in relation to the ‘objective problems, subjective values’ hypothesis. The results also point towards the necessity of simultaneously assessing the effect of individual- and contextual-level characteristics on environmental attitudes.},

	abstract = {Kina har opplevd en enorm økonomisk vekst siden 1970-tallet, noe som ofte blir referert til som et økonomisk mirakel. Det er også den store økonomiske veksten som har ledet landet inn i dagens miljøkrise. Stadig høyere miljøutslipp fører blant annet til høy forurensing i luften, innsjøer og elver. Formålet med denne oppgaven er å se på sammenhengen mellom økonomisk utvikling og forurensing for provinser i Kina. I denne oppgaven har jeg estimert eksistensen av miljø-Kuznets-kurver for provinser i Kina i årene 1997-2010. Miljø-Kuznets-kurver kan beskrives om forholdet som oppstår om inntekt og forurensing per innbygger først har en positiv sammenheng, og etter et vendepunkt, en negativ sammenheng. Dette vil ta fasong som en invertert U-kurve, og er en omdiskutert teori i litteraturen om miljøøkonomi. Litteraturen innenfor fagområdet diskuterer om en slik sammenheng mellom økonomisk utvikling og forurensing betyr at et bedre miljø vil oppstå av seg selv ved økonomisk utvikling, eventuelt om noe av prosessen vil skje automatisk. Det er imidlertid ofte påpekt at eksistensen av miljø-Kuznets-kurver er et resultat av at befolkningen stadig blir mer miljøbevisste etter hvert som mat og overlevelse ikke lenger er en bekymring. Dette vil derfor påvirke befolkningens prioriteringer, og et resultat vil være at mennesker blant annet vil redusere sine forurensingsutslipp. Jeg har hentet inn data for forurensingsutslipp fra provinser i Kina for miljøindikatorene svoveldioksid, sot, støv, fast avfall og vannavfall. Ved å bruke paneldata, estimerte jeg i denne oppgaven at forholdet mellom økonomisk utvikling og forurensing kan beskrives av kurver med fasong som en invertert-N for provinser i Kina. En invertert N-formet kurve vil oppstå når forholdet mellom økonomisk vekst og forurensing først har en negativ sammenheng. Etter et vendepunkt vil denne sammenhengen bli positiv. Kurven vil så nå et andre vendepunkt, hvor sammenhengen på ny blir negativ, og man forventer at videre økonomisk aktivitet fører til en reduksjon av miljøutslipp ved et høyt inntektsnivå. Jeg diskuterer også de miljømessige utfordringene og politiske implikasjonene Kina har møtt gjennom den høye veksten de siste 30 årene. Videre presenterer jeg teori og litteratur innenfor fagområdet.},

Former studies using the International Social Survey Programme ({ISSP}) report a positive effect, while studies using the World Values Survey ({WVS}) or the European Values Study ({EVS}) find the opposite. In this article, we explain and reconcile these opposing findings. Methods First, we analyze the three data sets ({ISSP}, {WVS}, and {EVS}) separately by applying multilevel analyses and replicate the different findings. Second, we take respondents’ acquiescence into account and demonstrate that wealth has a positive effect on the willingness to pay in the combined data set. Results Respondents in poorer nations in Asia and Eastern Europe have higher levels of acquiescence than respondents in richer Western nations. This difference conceals the wealth effect of studies analyzing the {WVS} or {EVS}. If acquiescence is properly taken into account, the wealth effect is confirmed. Conclusion Theory predicts that wealth and the willingness to protect the environment should be positively associated. This wealth effect is confirmed by our analyses of the {ISSP}, {WVS}, and {EVS}.},

In a cross-national survey, environmental concern was measured in terms of propensity to act and environmental risk perception. Results of a multilevel regression analysis show that these two measures respond to gross domestic product per capita in opposite ways. Citizens of advanced industrial countries are more likely than those of lower-income countries to contribute to environmental protection. However, they are less likely to see the harmful impacts on the environment as very dangerous. Using an indicator of national adaptive capacity, this article demonstrates that environmental risk perception is a function of a country’s estimated capacity for coping with condition changes. The stronger sense of collective security among citizens of wealthier nations offers a possible explanation for the negative effects of national income.

Features of the new edition include a reworking of the chapter on stated preference methods of valuation and new sections on topics in the valuation of effects on human health, the valuation of ecosystem functions and services, and benefits transfer. It targets several of the important advances since 1993 and integrates them within the basic framework of the first edition. Rick Freeman maintains the accessibility of the first edition while enhancing its relevance to current practice. Scholars and policymakers will welcome the work as an up-to-date reference on recent developments.

	isbn = {978-1-315-06056-9},
	shorttitle = {Using Surveys to Value Public Goods},
	abstract = {Economists and others have long believed that by balancing the costs of such public goods as air quality and wilderness areas against their benefits, informed policy choices can be made. But the problem of putting a dollar value on cleaner air or water and other goods not sold in the marketplace has been a major stumbling block. Mitchell and Carson, for reasons presented in this book, argue that at this time the contingent valuation ({CV}) method offers the most promising approach for determining public willingness to pay for many public goods---an approach likely to succeed, if used carefully, where other methods may fail. The result of ten years of research by the authors aimed at assessing how surveys might best be used to value public goods validly and reliably, this book makes a major contribution to what constitutes best practice in {CV} surveys.

Mitchell and Carson begin by introducing the contingent valuation method, describing how it works and the nature of the benefits it can be used to measure, comparing it to other methods for measuring benefits, and examining the data-gathering technique on which it is based---survey research. Placing contingent valuation in the larger context of welfare theory, the authors examine how the {CV} method impels a deeper understanding of willingness-to-pay versus willingness-to-accept compensation measures, the possibility of existence values for public goods, the role of uncertainty in benefit valuation, and the question of whether a consumer goods market or a political goods market (referenda) should be emulated. In developing a {CV} methodology, the authors deal with issues of broader significance to survey research. Their model of respondent error is relevant to current efforts to frame a theory of response behavior and bias typology will interest those considering the cognitive aspects of answering survey questions.

Mitchell and Carson conclude that the contingent valuation method can obtain valid valuation information on public goods, but only if the method is applied in a way that addresses the potential sources of error and bias. They end their book by providing guidelines for {CV} practitioners, a list of questions that should be asked by any decision maker who wishes to use the findings of a {CV} study, and suggestions for new applications of contingent valuation. Additional features include a comprehensive bibliography of the {CV} literature and an appendix summarizing more than 100 {CV} studies.},

Based on {CGSS} 2010 data about different regions in China, this study firstly analyzes the relationship between relative income and environmental concern and explore whether there are regional, urban-rural and gender differences in this relationship or not. Our regression result based on the whole sample reveals that without considering relative income, a 1\% increase in absolute income is associated with a 0.86 increase in environmental concern. But incorporating relative income in regression models, we find that absolute income does not exert an influence on environmental concern, and a 1\% increase in the percentile rank of income implies a 3.65 increase in environmental concern.},
